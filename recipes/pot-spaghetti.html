        <h1>Pot Spaghetti</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>My variation of an old Southern Living recipe - a double recipe will fill a 
                Dutch oven and make plenty for an extended family dinner.</p>

        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
           
            <ul>
                <ls>1 pound lean ground beef</ls>
                <ls>1 large onion, chopped</ls>
                <ls>2 cloves garlic, minced</ls>
                <ls>1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</ls>
                <ls>1 (14 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes</ls>
                <ls>2 cups water</ls>
                <ls>1 tablespoon chili powder</ls>
                <ls>1 teaspoon dried oregano</ls>
                <ls>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</ls>
                <ls>7 ounces whole wheat spaghetti</ls>
                <ls>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</ls>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <ls>Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, onion, 
                    and garlic until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                    Drain and discard excess grease.</ls>
                <ls>Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, water, chili powder, oregano, and black pepper. 
                    Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and let simmer, stirring often, for about 30 minutes.</ls>
                <ls>Break spaghetti into thirds and add to the pot; cover and simmer, stirring often, 
                    until pasta is tender, about 20 minutes. Serve topped with Parmesan cheese.</ls>
            </ol>
